# External sharing<a name="share-external"></a>

External sharing allows managed users of an Amazon WorkDocs site to share files and folders, and collaborate with external users without incurring extra costs\. Site users can share files and folders with external users without requiring recipients to be paid users of the Amazon WorkDocs site\. When you enable external sharing, users can enter the email address of the external user they want to share with and set appropriate viewer sharing permissions\. When external users are added, permissions are limited to viewer\-only, and other permissions are not available\. External users receive an email notification with a link to the shared file or folder\. Choosing the link takes external users to the site, where they enter their credentials to log in to Amazon WorkDocs\. They can see the shared file or folder in the **Shared with me** view\.

File owners can modify sharing permissions or remove access for the external user from a file or folder at any time\. External sharing for the site must be enabled by the site administrator in order for managed users to share content with external users\. For** Guest users** to become contributors or co\-owners, they must be upgraded to the **User** level by a site administrator\. For more information, see [User roles overview](users_ovw.md)\.

By default, external sharing is turned on and all users can invite external users\. To change this setting, update your **Security** settings from your admin control panel\. For more information, see [Managing Amazon WorkDocs from the site admin control panel](manage-sites.md)\.
