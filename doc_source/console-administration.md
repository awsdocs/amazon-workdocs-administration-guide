# Managing Amazon WorkDocs from the AWS console<a name="console-administration"></a>

You use these tools to manage your Amazon WorkDocs sites:
+ The AWS console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/zocalo/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/zocalo/)\.
+ The site admin control panel, available to administrators on all Amazon WorkDocs sites\.

Each of those tools provides a different set of actions, and the topics in this section explain the actions provided by the AWS console\. For information about the site admin control panel, see [Managing Amazon WorkDocs from the site admin control panel](manage-sites.md)\.
