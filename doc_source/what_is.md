# What Is Amazon WorkDocs?<a name="what_is"></a>

Amazon WorkDocs is a fully managed, secure, enterprise storage and sharing service with strong administrative controls and feedback capabilities that improve user productivity\. Your files are stored in [the cloud](https://aws.amazon.com//what-is-cloud-computing/), safely and securely\. Amazon WorkDocs even includes a synchronization application that always keeps selected folders on your local computer in sync with your cloud folders\. Your files are only visible to you, and your designated contributors and viewers\. Other members of your organization do not have access to any of your files unless you specifically grant them access\.

You can share your files with other members of your organization for collaboration or review\. The Amazon WorkDocs client applications can be used to view many different types of files, depending on the Internet media type of the file\. Amazon WorkDocs supports all common document and image formats, and support for additional media types is constantly being added\.

## Accessing<a name="accessing"></a>

Administrators use the [Amazon WorkDocs console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/zocalo/) to create and deactivate Amazon WorkDocs sites and the [Amazon WorkDocs Administration Dashboard](admin_dashboard.md) to manage permissions and users\.

+ A document synchronization app used to synchronize a folder on your Mac or Windows desktop with your Amazon WorkDocs files\.

+ Web clipper browser extensions for several popular web browsers that allow you to save an image of a web page to your Amazon WorkDocs files\.
