# What is Amazon WorkDocs?<a name="what_is"></a>

Amazon WorkDocs is a fully managed, secure enterprise storage and sharing service with strong administrative controls and feedback capabilities that improve user productivity\. Files are stored in [the cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-computing/), safely and securely\. Your user's files are only visible to them, and their designated contributors and viewers\. Other members of your organization do not have access to other user's files unless they are specifically granted access\. 

Users can share their files with other members of your organization for collaboration or review\. The Amazon WorkDocs client applications can be used to view many different types of files, depending on the Internet media type of the file\. Amazon WorkDocs supports all common document and image formats, and support for additional media types is constantly being added\. 

For more information, see [Amazon WorkDocs](https://aws.amazon.com/workdocs/)\. 

## Accessing Amazon WorkDocs<a name="accessing"></a>

Administrators use the [Amazon WorkDocs console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/zocalo/) to create and deactivate Amazon WorkDocs sites\. With the admin control panel, they can manage users, storage, and security settings\. For more information, see [Managing Amazon WorkDocs from the site admin control panel](manage-sites.md) and [Inviting and managing Amazon WorkDocs users](users.md)\.

Non\-administrative users use the client applications to access their files\. They never use the Amazon WorkDocs console or the administration dashboard\. Amazon WorkDocs offers several different client applications and utilities:
+ A web application used for document management and reviewing\.
+ Native apps for mobile devices used for document review\.
+ Amazon WorkDocs Drive, an app that synchronizes a folder on your macOS or Windows desktop with your Amazon WorkDocs files\.
