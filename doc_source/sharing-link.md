# Sharing links<a name="sharing-link"></a>

Users can choose **Share a link** to quickly copy and share hyperlinks for Amazon WorkDocs content with coworkers and external users both inside and outside their organization\. When users share a link, they can configure it to allow one of the following access options:
+ All members of the Amazon WorkDocs site can search for, view, and comment on the file\.
+ Anyone with the link, even people who are not members of the Amazon WorkDocs site, can view the file\. This link option restricts permissions to viewing only\.

Recipients with viewing permissions can only view a file\. Commenting permissions enable users to comment and perform update or delete operations, such as uploading a new file or deleting an existing file\.

By default, all managed users can create public links\. To change this setting, update your **Security** settings from your admin control panel\. For more information, see [Managing Amazon WorkDocs from the site admin control panel](manage-sites.md)\.
