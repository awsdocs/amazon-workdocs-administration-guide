# Turning off Auto activation<a name="auto-provision"></a>

You turn off Auto activation when you don't want to add all the users in a directory to a new site, and when you want to set different permissions and roles for the users that you invite to a new site\. When you turn Auto activation off, you can also decide who has the ability to invite new users to the site â€” current users, power users, or administrators\. These steps explain how to do both tasks\.

**To turn off Auto activation**

1. Choose the profile icon in the upper\-right corner of the WorkDocs client\.

1. Under **Admin**, choose **Open admin control panel**\.

1. Scroll down to **Security** and choose **Change**\.

   The **Policy Settings** dialog box appears\.

1. Under **Auto activation**, clear the check box next to **Allow all users in your directory to be automatically activated upon their first login to your WorkDocs site\.**

   The options change under **Who should be allowed to activate directory users in your WorkDocs site**\. You can let current users invite new users, or you can give that ability to power users or other administrators\.

1. Select an option, then choose ****Save Changes****\.

Repeat steps 1\-4 to re\-enable Auto activation\.
