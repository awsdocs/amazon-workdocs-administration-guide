# Connecting to an On\-Premise Directory<a name="connect_directory"></a>

You have two options for connecting to your on\-premises directory: can either use AWS Directory Service AD Connector, or you can use AWS Microsoft AD\. 

**Note**  
If you are part of a compliance program, such as PCI, FedRAMP, or DoD, you must set up a Microsoft AD Directory to meet compliance requirements\.
