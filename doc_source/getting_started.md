# Getting Started with Amazon WorkDocs<a name="getting_started"></a>

Amazon WorkDocs is based on organizations that include the users who belong to the organization, as well as information about each user's folders and documents\. The organization information is stored in an AWS Directory Service directory, either a Simple AD directory or an AD Connector directory\. You can enable Amazon WorkDocs to work with an existing directory, or you can have Amazon WorkDocs create a directory for you\. 

**Note**  
If you are part of a compliance program, such as PCI, FedRAMP, or DoD, you must set up a Microsoft AD Directory to meet compliance requirements\.
