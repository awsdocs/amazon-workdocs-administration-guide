## Before You Begin<a name="existing-dir-prereqs"></a>
+ You must have an existing AWS Directory Service directory in the current region\. This can be either a Simple AD directory or an AD Connector directory\. 
+ If you are part of a compliance program, such as PCI, FedRAMP, or DoD, you must set up a AWS Managed Microsoft AD Directory to meet compliance requirements\. For more information, see [Getting Started with AWS Managed Microsoft AD](connect_directory_microsoft.md)\.
+ When you launch a new Amazon WorkDocs site, you must specify profile information for the administrator, including first and last name and an email address\.
