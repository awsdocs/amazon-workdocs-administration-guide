# Enabling Single Sign\-On<a name="single_sign_on"></a>

AWS Directory Service allows users to access Amazon WorkDocs from a computer joined to the same directory with which Amazon WorkDocs is registered, without entering credentials separately\. For more information, see [Single Sign\-On](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/single_sign_on.html) in the *AWS Directory Service Administration Guide*\.

Your Amazon WorkDocs users may need to modify their web browser settings to enable single sign\-on\. For more information, see [Enabling Single Sign\-On](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workdocs/latest/userguide/web_client_help.html#single_sign_on) in the *Amazon WorkDocs User Guide*\.
