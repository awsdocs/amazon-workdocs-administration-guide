# Exporting the site\-wide activity feed<a name="site-activity"></a>

Admins can view and export the activity feed for an entire site\. To use this feature, you must first install Amazon WorkDocs Companion\. To install Amazon WorkDocs Companion, see [Apps & Integrations for Amazon WorkDocs](https://amazonworkdocs.com/apps.html)\.

**To view and export a site\-wide activity feed**

1. In the web application, choose **Activity**\.

1. Choose **Filter**, then move the **Site\-wide activity** slider to turn the filter on\.

1. Select **Activity Type** filters and choose **Date Modified** settings as needed, then choose **Apply**\.

1. When the filtered activity feed results appear, search by file, folder, or user name to narrow your results\. You can also add or remove filters as needed\.

1. Choose **Export** to export the activity feed to `.csv` and `.json` files on your desktop\. The system exports the files to one of the following locations:
   + **Windows** – **WorkDocsDownloads** folder in your PC's **Downloads** folder
   + **macOS** – `/users/username/WorkDocsDownloads/folder`

   The exported file reflects any filters that you apply\.
**Note**  
Users who are not administrators can view and export the activity feed for their own content only\. For more information, see [Viewing the Activity Feed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workdocs/latest/userguide/activity_feed.html) in the *Amazon WorkDocs User Guide*\.
