# Disabling Users<a name="inactive-user"></a>

You can disable a user's access by changing their status to **Inactive**\.

**To change user status to **Inactive****

1. From the **Admin Control Panel**, under **Manage Users**, choose the pencil icon \(![\[pencil icon\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/workdocs/latest/adminguide/images/pencil_icon.png)\) next to the user's name\.

1. Choose **Inactive**, and choose **Save Changes**

The inactivated user no longer has access to your Amazon WorkDocs site\.

**Note**  
Changing a user to **Inactive** status does not delete their files, folders, or feedback from your Amazon WorkDocs site\. However, you can transfer files and folders to an active user\. For more information, see [Transferring Document Ownership](transfer-docs.md)\.
