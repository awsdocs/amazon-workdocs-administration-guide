# Disabling Users<a name="inactive-user"></a>

You can disable a user's access by changing their status to **Inactive**\.

**To change user status to **Inactive****

1. From the **Admin Control Panel**, under **Manage Users**, choose the pencil icon \(![\[pencil icon\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/workdocs/latest/adminguide/images/pencil_icon.png)\) next to the user's name\.

1. Choose **Inactive**, and choose **Save Changes**

The inactivated user no longer has access to your Amazon WorkDocs site\.

**Note**  
Changing a user to **Inactive** status does not delete their files, folders, or feedback from your Amazon WorkDocs site\. However, you can transfer files and folders to an active user\. For more information, see [Transferring Document Ownership](transfer-docs.md)\.

## Deleting Pending Users \(Simple AD Only\)<a name="delete_user_cloud"></a>

You can only delete Simple AD users that are in **Pending** status\. To delete one of these users, choose the trash can icon \(![\[trash can icon\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/workdocs/latest/adminguide/images/trash_can_icon.png)\) next to the user's name\.

You must always have at least one active user for your Amazon WorkDocs site\. If you want to delete all users, you must delete your entire Amazon WorkDocs site\.

We do not recommend that you delete registered users\. Instead, you should switch a user from **Active** to **Inactive** status, so that they do not have access to your Amazon WorkDocs site\.
