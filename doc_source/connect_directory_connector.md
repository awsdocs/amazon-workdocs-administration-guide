# Connecting to Your On\-Premises Directory with AWS Directory Service AD Connector<a name="connect_directory_connector"></a>

You can use an AWS Directory Service AD Connector directory to connect to your on\-premises directory\. To use AD Connector to connect to your on\-premises directory, you must meet the prerequisites identified in [AD Connector Prerequisites](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/connect_prereq.html) in the *AWS Directory Service Administration Guide*\.

**Note**  
If you use AD Connector with Amazon WorkDocs, you wonâ€™t be able to share file view links outside the company or invite external users to become contributors\.

To connect to your on\-premises directory, perform the following steps\.

**To connect to your on\-premises directory**

1. Open the Amazon WorkDocs console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/zocalo/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/zocalo/)\.

   If you have never created or connected a directory in the selected region, you see the Amazon WorkDocs start page\. After you create a directory in a particular region, the start page is no longer available and you see the **Manage Your WorkDocs Sites** page instead\.

1. If you are on the Amazon WorkDocs start page, perform the following steps:

   1. Choose **Get Started Now**\.

   1. On the **Get Started with WorkDocs** page, choose **Launch** under **Standard Setup**\.

   If you are on the **Manage Your WorkDocs Sites** page, perform the following steps:

   1. Choose **Create a New WorkDocs Site**\.

   1. On the **Get Started with WorkDocs** page, choose **Launch** under **Standard Setup**\.

1. In the **Set up a Directory** page, choose **Create AD Connector**\.

1. Enter the following values and then choose **Continue**\.

   1. Enter the following values in the **Directory Details** section:  
**Directory DNS**  
The fully\-qualified name of the on\-premises directory, such as corp\.example\.com\. Amazon WorkDocs can only access user accounts in this directory\. User accounts cannot be contained in a parent directory, such as example\.com\.  
**NetBIOS Name**  
The NetBIOS name of the on\-premises directory, such as CORP\.  
**Account Username**  
The username of a user in the on\-premises directory\.   
**Account Password**  
The password for the on\-premises user account\.  
**Confirm Password**  
Re\-enter the password for the on\-premises user account\. This is required to prevent typing errors before the directory is connected\.  
**DNS Address**  
The IP address of a DNS server or domain controller in your on\-premises directory\. This server must be accessible from each subnet specified below\.

     Enter the following values in the **Access Point** section:  
**Region**  
Verify the region\.  
**Site URL**  
Enter the URL for your Amazon WorkDocs site\.

     Enter the following values in the **VPC Configuration** section:  
**VPC**  
The VPC that the directory is connected to\.  
**Subnets**  
The subnets in the VPC to use to connect to your on\-premises directory\. The two subnets must be in different Availability Zones\.

1. Review the directory information and make any necessary changes\. When the information is correct, click **Connect Directory**\.

   It takes several minutes for the directory to be connected and the Amazon WorkDocs site to be created\. When the directory has been successfully connected, the **Status** value of the site changes to `Active`\.
